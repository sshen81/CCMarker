CCMarker
========

CCMarker is a World of Warcraft AddOn that allows party leaders to easily set crowd control raid icons on targets. It takes into account creature types and party composition to create a crowd control priority list for targeting enemy units. When CCMarker is enabled, the player simply selects targets and they will automatically be marked for crowd control.
